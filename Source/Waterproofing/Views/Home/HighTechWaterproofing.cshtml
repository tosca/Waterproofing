                                            We have worked very hard to develop and HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED HUNDREDS of seamless, waterproof polyureathane foam injection used for foundation cracks. Our system permanently locks out the elements that give you trouble: water, moisture, soil gases, rodents, and cold air. <br />
                                            <br />Polyurethane foam injection fills the crack or joint with a resin that expands in the presence of moisture. Unlike epoxy, polyurethane foam is flexible enough to accommodate movement in the crack or joint due to changing soil pressures or minor settlement.

                                    We had our basement crawl space weather/water-proofed and insulated.  We are now able to use it for storage space which is terrific!  Adds a whole additional room for storage which makes all the difference in our home as we don't have attic space.  Also, has made the room above the crawl space much warmer during the cold winter months... We couldn't be happier!

                                    I have just completed my inspection of one of your encapsulation systems as part of my water intrusion inspection, using a Flir Thermal Imaging camera.<br />
                                    I found that it is the best example of an encapsulation that I have ever seen. There is a near perfect barrier from moisture intrusion and heat loss.<br />
                                    I have not found and have not been able to assure, as a contractor, for my clients, the kind of protection which is required and just cannot get from any other systems on the market, the kind of protection your system delivers perfectly.

        <p class="lead">Excellent! High Tech Waterproofing was able to fix what other vendors could not and a much more reasonable price. No more leaky walls! If you have leaky walls, basements, crawlspaces, etc., my advice is to definitely call High Tech Waterproofing.</p>
        <p class="lead">
            They do excellent work for a fraction of the price of other vendors. Some other outfits tried to sell me on replacing drain tiles to the tune of thousands of dollars.

                                <p class="lead">THIS STORY IS OF HOW HIGH TECH TOOK CARE OF AN EXISTING PROBLEM THEN THE CRAWLSPACE.</p>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    A Pamphlet was provided describing the process and material to be used.
                                    Morning team arrived on time to clear and level spaces and remove old, creepy insulation.
                                    Afternoon team arrived on time to encapsulate.

                                <p class="lead">Next day...WATER in one crawlspace!  I called and High Tech sent out a great guy who vacuumed and mopped up water.  It turns out our air conditioning unit was dripping water all those years. A call to the HVAC guy who had been servicing the unit for 20 years solved the problem.   While it was NOT High Tech Waterproofing’s problem, the company was very responsive.</p>
                                <p class="lead">NO MORE STANKY HOUSE!</p>
                                <p class="lead">We did this work in advance of selling the house. I am sure that the three offers in 36 hours would never have happened had it not been for the improvement of the crawls.</p>

                                <p class="lead">In the last few years my crawlspace had been smelling pretty musty so after checking Angie's list, I found this company that advertised this Polyurea liner for the crawlspace. He was prompt & answered all my questions (I had a lot). Everything was completed in one day. They cleaned up after themselves & didn't leave any mess. If you need any crawlspace or basement waterproofing done, you won't go wrong with this company. </p>

Felt the price was fair considering we would never have to worry about seams or taped joints in the encapsulation system.  The liner is quite thick.</p>
