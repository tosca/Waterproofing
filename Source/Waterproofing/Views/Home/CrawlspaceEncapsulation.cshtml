                                                    We have worked very hard to develop and now successfully apply a seamless, waterproof spray-on polyurea liner system used to encapsulate crawlspaces. The key word here is "ENCAPSULATION", which means permanently locking out the elements that give you trouble:  water, moisture, soil gases, rodents, and cold air. 
                                                    <br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    The only way to protect the crawlspace envelope, is to install a system that starts off and remains SEAMLESS.  The materials, polyurea and closed-cell spray foam, have a long history as safe and remarkably resilient materials perfectly suited to keep those trouble elements from entering your crawlspace.
                                                     <br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    The benefits of this system are unmatched by anything on the market, we know because we have installed many of the other systems, including concrete and taped plastic vapor barriers. Now, we just prefer to offer you the best. You will NOT find another crawlspace encapsulation system that can beat this technology.  Seamless, incredibly durable and fast drying, this polyurea spray-on liner is packed with life long benefits. </p>

                                                <p class="lead lead-md">We have a long list of satisfied customers that have this system installed, so don't forget to ask us for customer referrals who would be happy to tell you about their new CRAWLSPACE.</p>

                                          I have just completed my inspection of one of your encapsulation systems as part of my water intrusion inspection, using a Flir Thermal Imaging camera.<br />
                                          I found that it is the best example of an encapsulation that I have ever seen. There is a near perfect barrier from moisture intrusion and heat loss.<br />
                                          I have not found and have not been able to assure, as a contractor, for my clients, the kind of protection which is required and just cannot get from any other systems on the market, the kind of protection your system delivers perfectly.

Afternoon team arrived on time to encapsulate.

It turns out our air conditioning unit was dripping water all those years. A call to the HVAC guy who had been servicing the unit for 20 years solved the problem.   While it was NOT High Tech Waterproofing’s problem, the company was very responsive.</p>

                                          I'm very pleased I chose High Tech.  They are prompt, polite, professional, keep your house clean and do a great job.  From beginning to end, everything was seamless (just like my new liner!!).
