                                                    We have worked very hard to develop and now successfully apply a seamless, waterproof spray-on polyurea liner system used to encapsulate crawlspaces. The key word here is "ENCAPSULATION", which means permanently locking out the elements that give you trouble:  water, moisture, soil gases, rodents, and cold air. 
                                                    <br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    The only way to protect the crawlspace envelope, is to install a system that starts off and remains SEAMLESS.  The materials, polyurea and closed-cell spray foam, have a long history as safe and remarkably resilient materials perfectly suited to keep those trouble elements from entering your crawlspace.
                                                     <br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    The benefits of this system are unmatched by anything on the market, we know because we have installed many of the other systems, including concrete and taped plastic vapor barriers. Now, we just prefer to offer you the best. You will NOT find another crawlspace encapsulation system that can beat this technology.  Seamless, incredibly durable and fast drying, this polyurea spray-on liner is packed with life long benefits. </p>

                                I found that it is the best example of an encapsulation that I have ever seen. There is a near perfect barrier from moisture intrusion and heat loss.<br />
                                I have not found and have not been able to assure, as a contractor, for my clients, the kind of protection which is required and just cannot get from any other systems on the market, the kind of protection your system delivers perfectly.
